- MineColonies crashes experienced in 2.3.0 should be mostly handled.

## [2.3.0] - 2020-09-11

### Updates
- Added a new storage solution! Dank Storage compresses NBT data and is relatively simplistic to use. It doesn't interfere with the aesthetic of the pack. I've tied it nicely with Mine and Slash and Create + Immersive Engineering. As a result, I've also added some quests to guide players in crafting the storage blocks. Dank is nice because the storage blocks actually triple up in functionality - they can be used as chests, backpacks, and tools (see in-game for details). Don't worry though! The current bags still have a use... they're just not as good in the late game!
- Added a quest to showcase Ender Mail.
- Removed the bullet, turret, railgun, and revolver recipes and from the JEI.
- Increased dungeon spawn rates significantly across the board.

- Decreased spawn rate of lava monsters slightly.

- Updated Corpse, Pam's HarvestCraft 2 Foodcore, TelePass, Performant, MineColonies.
- Added Curious Elytra - adds a Curios slot for the elytra.
- Added Inventory Totem - no longer need to hold totems for their effects to occur. Just have it in your inventory.

### Fixes
- No more HWYLA console spam caused when looking at a Corpse corpse. This also caused a fair bit of lag too. Rejoice!
- TelePass's should work as intended now.
- Fixed a dependency issue related to the 'Quartz' quest.
- No more random suffocation when joining the world or the mining dimension.
- Fixed having a second instance of the Mage's Robes set.
- I put the text fix for 'Your Engineering Degree' in the wrong quest. Fixed.

## [2.2.6] - 2020-09-02

### Updates
- Added the Tool Belt mod which introduces the tool belt. Access the radial menu with the tool belt key (Default: V) after equipping it. The default is 'V' for new installations of CtE. If you're updating then you'll need to change it from 'R'.

- Fixed some issues with spawning in causing crashes.
- Fixed having advanced tooltips on by default.

## [2.2.5] - 2020-08-27

### Updates
- Loot from treasure chests is now instanced per player. This means players will roll for loot separately from chests (so don't break chests you come across, save it for others!). This is new and there may be bugs, but should improve the new player experience on servers!
- MineColonies now has a FindMe-like function once the warehouse is upgraded to level 3.

- Added Lootr.
- Added Drawers Tooltip.
- Added Miner's Helmet.
- Added TelePass.
- Added FPS Reducer - reduces FPS automatically upon inactivity or window minimization.

### Fixes

- Improved village detection on world creation with TerraForged.
- Fixed steel sword reward to be iron sword for a particular quest.
- Trites should spawn in The End.
- Zombie horse spawns should be fixed.

## [2.2.4b] - 2020-08-21

### Fixes
- Actually added TerraForged this time.

## [2.2.4] - 2020-08-21

### Updates
- Ported the changes I made before, The Bumblezone is still optional.

### Mod Changes
- Added Custom Quests.
- Removed FTB Quests.

## [2.2.3] - 2020-08-21
The FTB Quests for Custom Quests change is likely a temporary fix until Custom Quest's rewrite comes out. This will probably result in another quest reset... And I apologize for that in advance. But the problems with current CQ are too great to ignore. The rewrite will likely not be available for a while, anyway. And I still would have to port stuff so that would take extra time. This change lets me make progression a lot more smooth! Thanks for supporting Craft to Exile.

Note: this update does NOT introduce shared questing. That will come with the CQ rewrite!

### Updates
- Working dimension detection, and selectable rewards are now available! This will require a quest reset, sorry! To access the new quest GUI, you'll need to set a key in your controls or use the new quest book. If you're installing a fresh install of [Dissonance], the default key is 'J'. TEAM QUESTING is still not available. I really thought FTB Quests had it, but it will not be implemented, apparently. In a few weeks time, Custom Quest's rewrite will be finished, and I can port all of the quests back over. There will be team questing, and everything nice.
- The Bumblezone is now an optional dimension.
- Added new quests to improve new player experience.
- TerraForged has been added due to popular demand and is the default world type for singleplayer worlds.

### Mod Changes
- Updated MineColonies, Xaero's Minimap/Worldmap, Clumps.
- Added TerraForged.
- Added Default World Type (Forge).

- Reduced XP loss on death by half.
- Bosses appear more frequently in maps.
- Reduced damage of all mobs except bosses by roughly 20%.
- Added Mine and Slash ores to chest loot tables!
- Added special cases for Ender Dragon and the Wither. They should be more in line with the power level of other bosses and will always spawn at the max level of their respective zones.
- Re-balanced some Bountiful objectives, some items were given way too much value (64 sticks for a loot box...)
- Added some more Bountiful objectives from other mods!
- Time no longer passes in the Good Night dimensions.
- Reduced Lava Monster spawn rate.
- Updated YUNG's Better Cave generation to be less 'spacious'.
- Riddle Chests have less characters to choose from so should be a little easier to "guess". They also spawn more rarely now.

## [2.2.0b] - 2020-08-07

### Updates

- RoughMobs can spawn aboveground again.

### Mod Changes
- Downgraded Performant yet again.

## [2.2.0] - 2020-08-07

### Updates

- Act VII - new dimension: Tofu World! Explore this dimension after you've finished the Midnight... Wait, could this cute dimension be the source of all evil? Don't be deceived by the adorable creatures, they will try to kill you! Get to the Tofu World by making tofu. Grill the tofu and create a portal. You'll also need soy milk as well as a tofu stick (all explained in quest log). You can only craft the tofu stick once you've accessed the Midnight! Tofu World also brings about some new foods to try out!
- Enabled Tofu World compatibility with other mods, including crafting equipment.
- Added a new Act VII chapter in the quest log for Tofu World.
- Progression for The Bumblezone has been reduced from levels 10-18 to 14-18. This change is in part, due to performance issues. But I also find that the zone itself is a little barren at times.
- Modified some Bumblezone quest requirements to be easier/shorter.
- You are now expected to stay in the Overworld for longer. As a result, experience from OW quests has been increased by 50%.
- Added actual textures for all unique items (except bows)! Uniques will now also display their appropriate names.
- Added 4 new quests for mechanics that may be overlooked.
- Reduced efficiency of centrifuge, also changed its recipe to use honeycomb.
- High tier honeycomb variants are now harder to come by in The Bumblezone.
- Reduced vanilla mob health. I didn't notice Rough Mobs Revamped was effectively doubling the HP of some of the vanilla mobs... 80+ hp level 2 zombies are not cool.
- Reduced chance for vanilla mobs to spawn with equipment.
- Some general performance changes - should run a little smoother now (YMMV).
- Disabled feral wolves and lammer[...] from Better Animals Plus. It seems like trying to tame them still causes issues even though I thought I disabled taming.
- Reduced tarantula spawns from Better Animals Plus. They were just so, so many.

### Mod Changes
- Updated to Forge 31.2.36.
- Updated MineColonies, Immersive Engineering, Xaero's, Performant, Sound Filters.

- Added Dynamic View - server side dynamic chunk viewer.
- Added Copy-Paste - no longer need to manually update your server configs!
- Removed It's The Little Things since Random Patches offers similar functionality.
- Removed Advanced Skin Customization - causing a few GUI glitches and isn't the most important mod to have for now. Might make a return in the future.

### Fixes
- Mine and Slash uniques compendium can be viewed without crashing now!
- Fixed wording on some quests.
- Fixed up some bow uniques.
